# HotkeyMod
Simple hotkey mod for The Long Dark game made by Hinterland Studios.  
When you install this mod, it generates a json, and there, you can customize gearitems and hotkeys.  
You can define more than one item to a hotkey.  
When equiping firearms, guns with the most bullets in the magazine will be equiped. (If in the json list)  
When equiping torches, the one item with the LEAST codition comes up. In vanilla, it's the one with the highest condition.  
The basic rule after the above rules: first item in the list is going to be equiped.  
Clothes and accessories are supported too, and there is a toggle function implemented, so first tap equips specified clothing item, second tap switches back the original item if there was any.  
# Installation
Download and place the dll file into your \Mods folder.  
Locate your new tld_hotkeys.json file after your first game start in \TheLongDark\UserData and edit it to your liking.  
For the name of the keys you should check: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html  
Defaults are F1, F2 etc. I personally use Alpha1, etc. instead of the vanilla hotkeys.  
In the Json file the setup for clothes works like this: there should be: ":1" or ":2" after the gear name of the clothing, this specifies which slot the clothing goes. 1 means inner layer (or first accessory slot), 2 means outer layer (and second accessory slot).
